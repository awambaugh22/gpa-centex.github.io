Hi, my name is Nita.  I thought I would be a racer when I grew up, but decided that just wasnâ€™t  the life for me. 

I'm adjusting to my new home quickly though.  My new little dog pal, Tucker, is teaching me all sorts of new things about living with people in a house.  My foster parents call me a couch potato, but I do get up to follow them into other rooms of the house.  Sometimes.  I like a nighttime walk, as long as it isn't too long or too hot or too fast.... My foster parents have been really happy that I'm housebroken. I get a little startled at sudden loud noises, and I don't like it when people walk behind me.  But I've already adjusted to the blender, the coffee maker, the TV and the ceiling fan, so I think I'm doing ok.  I also aced the stairs.  Oh, and this being petted thing, it's great! I like to lean against my foster family and let them scratch behind my ears.  I think I'd do really well being adopted into any type of loving home, with or without other animals.
